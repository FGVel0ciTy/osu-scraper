## osu-scraper
Simple web scraper for osu! profiles. This project is my first attempt making something with Python and first attempt making a web scraper. My goals for this project were to learn Python syntax, features, and try something that dealt with the internet. I think this is a semi-decent attempt lol.

## Getting Started
You must have a python environment with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and the requests modules.

## Future Goals
* Implement multithreading/processing to speed up the data fetching. (Hilariously slow rn)
* Create a GUI that can make the experience a lot more intuitive
* Refactor the code so it's not disgusting
* Learn how to make this project an executable

## Built With

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - IDE used
* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - Web Scraping library
