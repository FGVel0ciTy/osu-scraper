## osu-scraper
Simple web scraper for osu! profiles. This project is my first attempt making something with Python and first attempt making a web scraper. My goals for this project were to learn Python syntax, features, and try something that dealt with the internet. I think this is a semi-decent attempt lol.

## Getting Started
All you need to run this is PyCharm community edition with all its prerequisites

## Future Goals
* Implement multithreading/processing to speed up the data fetching. (Hilariously slow rn)
* Create a GUI that can make the experience a lot more intuitive
* Learn how to make this project an executable

## Built With
